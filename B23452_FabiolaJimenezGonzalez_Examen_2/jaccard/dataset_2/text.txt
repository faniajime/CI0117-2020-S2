TECHNOLOGY NEW ERA FOR INFORMATION HANDLING By Lawrence Edelman Reuters NEW YORK March 9 Ground breaking new systems for storing and retrieving information are ushering in a new era for computer companies and computer users Within the past few weeks International Business Machines Corp EK and others have launched products that radically increase the amount of data that can be catalogued and shelved in computerized libraries This flurry of new technology could yield systems that handle a multimedia blitz of data said Ian Warhaftig a senior analyst with International Data Corp Framingham Mass We re developing new systems because our customers are asking for them Peter Giles vice president and general manager of Kodak s mass memory division said in a recent interview This demand is expected to soar in coming years While estimates vary industry analysts project that providing products and services geared for information storage and retrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by 1995 A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet the varying requirements of users For example a large credit verification service would want a system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data and relay it to its clients A law firm however may need a computerized law library in which capacity rather than speed is the key feature For architects and engineers the ability to store photographs sketches and other graphics would be crucial Regardless of the specific application the trend is toward converting information documents video or film or even sound recordings into to the digital language of zeros and ones understood by computers Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data for storage An optical disk the size of a standard compact disk can store 550 megabytes of data or about 250 000 pages of typewritten text For this reason the compact disk read only memory or CD ROM is already a popular data storage media Last week Microsoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf a 300 dlr program that contains on a single CD ROM disk a dictionary thesaurus national ZIP code directory Bartlett s Familiar Quotations the World Almanac and other reference works Scores of such products are already on the market but most are specialty items such as Lotus Development Corp s LOTS CD ROM data base of stock information for financial analysts and investors Microsoft Bookshelf is important because it marks the arrival of CD ROM packages for the general public said Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp One drawback of the CD ROM which uses a laser to record and read data is that that it requires a special player CD ROM players for the retail market will appear later this year Moreover IDC s Warhaftig said CD ROM s will be integrated with personal computers Eventually CD ROM s will fit right inside the PC box he said Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker and thesaurus at your fingertips when you re writing with a word processing program But CD ROM s are just the beginning Also last week Kodak unveiled several systems that use 12 inch optical disks The largest Kodak system uses a jukebox like cabinet to hold up to 150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matter of seconds Kodak also announced a 14 inch optical disk with 6 8 gigabytes of memory five times the memory of a CD ROM The Kodak disk which will not be available until the middle of 1988 is designed for users who need quick access to very large amounts of data said Kodak s Giles Meanwhile N V Philips PGLO AS the Dutch electronics giant is preparing to take optical disk technology a step further with the first disk that can combine text video and sound Philips said the system called Called CD Interactive will be ready next year It will include a new kind of CD ROM player that can hook up with a television set and stereo Additional breakthroughs are expected as the next generation of computer memory chips are introduced Last month IBM said it has made a four megabyte chip capable of storing more data than eight CD ROM s Meantime Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan said it has built a 16 megabyte chip Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are several years away though some suspect that IBM may start volume production of its four megabyte chip sometime this year Such chips will enable computer makers to build computers with immense memory capacities Reuter

AUSTRALIAN WAGE RISE SET AT 10 DLRS A WEEK MELBOURNE March 10 The Arbitration Commission awarded the Australian workforce a flat 10 dlrs a week wage increase and allowed trade unions to begin bargaining for a second tier increase of up to four pct Commission President Justice Barry Maddern said here The decision is effective from the next pay period of individual employers he said in delivering the Commission s National Wage Case decision Full time adult ordinary time weekly earnings are 453 00 dlrs a week for males and 428 40 dlrs for all adults according to latest official statistics The wage decision is the first under the previously announced two tier system which replaced the concept of wage indexation It is the first national wage rise since a partially indexed increase of 2 3 pct was awarded by the Commission last July The decision is a compromise between the Federal government s call at the Wage Case hearing for a 10 dlr weekly rise plus a three pct second tier ceiling and the Australian Council of Trade Unions ACTU claim of 20 dlrs and up to four pct Employer groups had sought no rise at all The Commission is willing to convene another Wage Case in October to establish if another wage increase of up to 1 5 pct should be awarded Maddern said He said the success of the new system depended on the commitment of all parties employers unions and governments He said the Commission had rejected employers calls for a freeze on overall labour cost increases We do not think that such an outcome is feasible given the needs and expectations of wage and salary earners he said adding a freeze could have destroyed the possibility of a cooperative effort to lift Australia s economic performance The decision would ensure the effects of the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the adverse terms of trade would not be reflected in wage increases Maddern said If necessary it would arbitrate second tier claims at an implementation rate of no more than two pct from September this year and a further two pct from July 1988 he said He said labour cost rises would be phased in over the life of the package adding that second tier rises will be mainly achieved by a restructuring and efficiency principle covering elimination of restrictive work practices improved efficiency and productivity and reduction of demarcation disputes Maddern said the Commission again ruled out claims for a cut in weekly working hours below 38 and allowed employers to be exempted from wage case decisions on the basis of severe or extreme economic adversity The Commission said the poor economic outlook noted in its last decision had persisted and was perhaps now more serious The prevailing uncertainty and lack of confidence in the economy which underlines the economic circumstances must be allayed to halt further decline and to turn the economy around In this connection what happens to labour costs is of critical importance he said REUTER

NAKASONE SET TO STAY UNTIL TAX REFORM APPROVED By Yuko Nakamikado Reuters TOKYO March 11 Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will step down only after his plan to overhaul Japan s tax system gets parliamentary approval one of his closest aides said today The aide who declined to be identified said at a private meeting Nakasone s power in office does not necessarily terminate at the end of his term in October It depends on when the seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite Sunday s unexpected Upper House by election defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP in a conservative stronghold The socialist winner backed by other opposition parties had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added sales tax the main plank of the reform plans The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding nothing but retraction of the tax They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the 1987 fiscal year starting on April 1 which includes the tax plans They have been resorting to an on off boycott of parliament since February 4 If I were Nakasone I would close the current regular parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled attend the Venice summit of industrial democracies in June and open an extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans the aide said Under law a regular session can be extended only once while an extraordinary session can be extended twice The other option would be to extend the current session he said The opposition parties will surely present a no confidence motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up the way for tax reform Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet en masse A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House for a snap general election the aide said That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign from the 512 seat Lower House necessitating by elections The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its landslide victory in general elections last July There are five independents and three vacancies The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate their seats but at the expense of fierce media criticism the aide said He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26 About 2 600 elections will be held in all but three of the nation s 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets Possible effects if any will be on gubernatorial elections in Japan s northernmost island of Hokkaido and Fukuoka in southern Japan he said The two posts are now held by opposition socialists REUTER

PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN HANOVER West Germany March 11 A spokesman for Preussag AG PRSG F said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985 Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985 Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group s other divisions The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986 adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65 0 mln marks from 103 0 mln the year before The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13 1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154 5 mln the year before Domestic group net profit fell to 77 9 mln from 122 2 mln The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year Preussag s domestic group turnover rose to 4 48 billion marks in 1986 from 4 29 billion in 1985 helped by the first time consolidation of 951 8 mln marks of turnover from its majority owned oil and gas subsidiary C Deilmann AG Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1 1 billion marks it said without giving comparison figures Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4 0 pct to 94 400 tonnes in 1986 while foreign oil production rose to 182 900 tonnes from 174 500 tonnes Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc AMC subsidiary whose results are included in the world group accounts made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year AMC s large losses in 1985 caused principally by the international tin crisis were the reason behind the world group losses that year REUTER

VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS EDMONTON Alberta March 11 Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture s annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils Balletto said Balletto estimated production of palm coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8 5 mln tonnes down from 9 1 mln tonnes last year enough to offset higher oilseed output He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33 4 mln tonnes up from 33 0 mln last year and disappearance at 34 0 mln tonnes up from 32 6 mln Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply he said disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600 000 tonnes the largest deficit since 1976 If world protein meal demand stagnates thus limiting the crush of soybeans the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop he said This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds Balletto said Oilseeds on the other hand remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies he said World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28 4 mln tonnes compared with 25 4 mln last year The increase should result from lower disappearance as production is expected to fall to 184 0 mln tonnes from 185 7 mln last year he said World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98 9 mln tonnes up from 90 6 mln the previous year Balletto said while production of other oilseeds was lower Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States he said Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus and U S stocks make up most of those Balletto said The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12 7 mln tonnes about half of the world soybean surplus he said Since 1983 84 he said world oilseed stocks have increased 13 1 mln tonnes During the same period U S soybean stocks increased 12 1 mln tonnes becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U S loan program Soybean prices and to a great extent world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program as long as the U S soybean surplus continues For the 1987 crop he said prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U S loan program Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U S loan rate The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds Balletto said Reuter

U S BANKS THRIFTS FACE CHANGE FROM SENATE BILL By Kenneth Barry WASHINGTON March 11 U S banks and savings and loan institutions could face important changes as a result of emergency legislation adopted overwhelmingly by the Senate Banking Committee The bill approved 12 6 yesterday would rescue the underfunded federal deposit insurance fund for thrifts and temporarily halt new developments in the provision of financial services The bill which goes to the full Senate will infuse a badly needed 7 5 billion dlrs into the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp which insures accounts of depositors It also limits banks ability to sell securities and restricts a new breed of competitor the so called nonbank banks Committee Chairman William Proxmire the bill s sponsor promised the committee will work on a long term plan for new developments in the financial services industry which is confronted by growing competition from firms in other commercial centers such as London and Tokyo This bill we are taking up today is the first step in this effort the Wisconsin Democrat said But Sen Jake Garn the committee s top Republican chastised senators for imposing temporary restrictions on financial providers It is time to forget the special interests the Utah senator said Garn failed to win approval for an amendment that would have eliminated virtually all of the bill s provisions except the rescue for FSLIC A major controversy focused on nonbank banks which offer limited financial services of a bank and avoid most banking regulations Proxmire succeeded in closing a loophole which would permit new nonbank banks and thrifts until Congress passes comprehensive bank reform a move welcomed by the bank industry But at the same time the bill set a moratorium on a number of new activities that banks may undertake including selling insurance securities and real estate for one year after the bill becomes law The 7 5 billion dlr rescue for FSLIC represented a compromise between a larger amount sought by the Reagan administration and a smaller figure proposed by the thrift industry The U S League of Savings Institutions an industry group feared approval of a larger amount for FSLIC would lead to a surge of closings of thrifts by federal superviors We hope the Congress will finally settle on a lower number William O Connell president of the league said after the committee voted Reuter

HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT By David Lewis Reuters BUDAPEST March 11 National Bank of Hungary first vice president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year s severe trade deficit with the West Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade It is useful to have a devaluation he said There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5 5 pct in 1986 This was partly an after effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s he added Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year But the country s hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539 4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295 3 mln in 1986 and 1 2 billion in 1985 Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs One Western commercial attache here said Devaluation of itself will not change anything It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market Hungary s net hard currency debt soared to 7 79 billion dlrs last year from 5 01 billion in 1985 partly because of a current account deficit of 1 42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation I am for credits to invest for that purpose he said I am against credits for consumption He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year from one pct in 1986 Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market where he considered rates to be low Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3 5 billion dlrs he said On the budget deficit which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985 Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43 8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints REUTER

NAKASONE SET TO STAY UNTIL TAX REFORM APPROVED By Yuko Nakamikado Reuters TOKYO March 11 Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will step down only after his plan to overhaul Japan s tax system gets parliamentary approval one of his closest aides said today The aide who declined to be identified said at a private meeting Nakasone s power in office does not necessarily terminate at the end of his term in October It depends on when the seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite Sunday s unexpected Upper House by election defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP in a conservative stronghold The socialist winner backed by other opposition parties had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added sales tax the main plank of the reform plans The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding nothing but retraction of the tax They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the 1987 fiscal year starting on April 1 which includes the tax plans They have been resorting to an on off boycott of parliament since February 4 If I were Nakasone I would close the current regular parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled attend the Venice summit of industrial democracies in June and open an extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans the aide said Under law a regular session can be extended only once while an extraordinary session can be extended twice The other option would be to extend the current session he said The opposition parties will surely present a no confidence motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up the way for tax reform Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet en masse A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House for a snap general election the aide said That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign from the 512 seat Lower House necessitating by elections The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its landslide victory in general elections last July There are five independents and three vacancies The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate their seats but at the expense of fierce media criticism the aide said He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26 About 2 600 elections will be held in all but three of the nation s 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets Possible effects if any will be on gubernatorial elections in Japan s northernmost island of Hokkaido and Fukuoka in southern Japan he said The two posts are now held by opposition socialists REUTER

DOCTORS FIND LINK BETWEEN AIDS SMALLPOX VIRUS BOSTON March 11 In a discovery that could complicate the search for an AIDS vaccine a team of U S Army doctors said they have uncovered a potentially fatal interaction between the AIDS virus and a virus used to protect against smallpox Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research said a 19 year old man who apparently had been exposed to the AIDS virus developed a pox like disease and died after receiving the smallpox vaccine The military now tests recruits for AIDS before vaccinating them The findings reported in The New England Journal of Medicine are significant because scientists have begun working on an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine Our case report raises provocative questions concerning the ultimate safety of such vaccines said the group led by Dr Robert Redfield The report also throws into question the belief held by some scientists that the smallpox vaccine which exposes people to a milder protective form of the disease known as cowpox could be further modified to protect people against a host of other diseases Reuter 
BIRTH CONTROL PILLS HELP PREVENT CANCER STUDY BOSTON March 11 Doctors at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said they have new evidence that birth control pills can help provide long term protection from cancer of the ovary even if the pills are only taken for a few months The study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine also found that all the various types of oral contraceptives on the market were equally effective in lowering the rate of ovarian cancer The researchers estimated that the use of birth control pills in this country probably prevented about 1 700 cases of ovarian cancer in 1982 As more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives move into the age groups that are at highest risk for epithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidence of this serious disease they said Specifically the team led by Dr Howard Ory found that oral contraceptive use even for a few months reduces the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to 54 years of age The effect probably takes from five to ten years to become apparent but it persists long after the use of oral contraceptives ends Moreover protection exists regardless of the formulation of oral contraceptive used they said Reuter

PHILLIPSP SAYS STOCK UP ON STEPS TO PARE DEBT NEW YORK March 11 Phillips Petroleum Co Chairman C J Pete Silas said his company s stock ranked fourth on the most active list of stocks traded today rose partly because of steps it took to pare its debt Silas told Reuters in an interview today part of this strength results from the rise in oil prices and also because some of the analysts have been happy with the steps we ve taken in 1986 to pare our debt Phillips stocks rose 1 4 to 14 dlrs a share following recommendations by some oil analysts a company source said Phillips debt stood at 5 9 billion dlrs in December 1986 down from a 1985 high of 8 6 billion dlrs analysts said At 14 dlrs a share Phillips is priced closer to the actual price of oil he added Silas said if the analysts are right that oil prices will rise to 20 dlrs or higher then it seems to make sense to buy Phillips He is however more cautious about the strength in crude prices expecting the price to fluctuate between 16 18 dlrs a barrel for the year Oil industry analysts said one reason for the stock s popularity of the stock is that it traded at a strong discount to its appraised value and was attractively priced for small investors Charles Andrew an analyst who follows Phillips for John S Herold Inc of Greenwich Conn said that the appraised value of the company based on available data is 34 25 dlrs The stock is trading at about 1 3 its appraised value The company has tremendous leverage and if it can get its act together and if oil prices are steady to higher there is good room for improvement he said But he added if oil prices turn lower there will be a lot of pressure on Phillips Phillips shares fell as low as eight dlrs a share over the last 52 weeks with a 1987 low of 11 3 4 dlrs in 1987 Analysts say that the appraised value of the company could be revised due to asset sales of their oil and gas reserves Silas told Reuters that the asset sales which amount to about two billion dlrs for 1986 were completed and that none were planned Reuter

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT PARIS BOURSE REFORM By Malcolm Whittaker and Franck Pauly Reuters PARIS March 12 French stockbrokers will lose their jealously guarded 180 year old monopoly of share trading over the next five years under reforms announced on Tuesday by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur But with the prospect of fresh money flooding into their seriously under capitalised share trading business there were few signs of regret over the gradual passing of an era It is a question of survival after London s Big Bang said private market analyst Edouard Cointreau Balladur said the long expected reform of the Bourse structure will progressively allow domestic and foreign banks to buy stakes in stockbrokers capital while at the same time brokers will be allowed access to the money markets The project foresees free access to the Bourse by January 1 1992 the date set for the opening of a unified European financial market The planned reform expected to be put before Parliament before the end of the Spring session will open up the capital of the 45 Paris and 15 regional stockbroker houses in three stages beginning on January 1 next year The aim of the move following the examples of Tokyo and London in opening up their tightly controlled membership was to take up the challenge of European financial integration and fierce international competition Balladur announced Cointreau founder and chairman of the private market analysis company Centre d Observation et de Prospective Sociales COPS said the reform was a natural development The Paris market is rising but that cannot go on for ever The brokers know it s a good time to sell part of their business he told Reuters The reform was inevitable given the European Community directive said Ben Williams of Paris brokerage house Fauchier Magnan From a French point of view one cannot be very disappointed he said but some brokers must be a bit worried as it is not entirely evident that all brokerage houses are worth a lot of money He said that with the expansion of the market generally here quality brokerage staff would do very well out of the reforms in salary terms But on the whole expertise is not very deep and the banks already have a lot of such expertise Dealers agreed generally that by allowing brokers to reinforce their equity capital the reform was expected to improve their ability to take large positions in stocks and bolster the liquidity of the Paris market The French Banking Association grouping domestic and foreign banks operating here welcomed the reforms French banks which only won direct access to the bond markets last September have never been happy with the stockbrokers continuing monopoly on share trading Brokers said it was too soon to say what form links with other foreign brokerage houses and banks might take Nobody is willing to talk about this yet but one can be sure that alliances have been formed over the past years Williams said Some brokers said the opening up of their capital to banks could pose questions such as whether the major banks might all aim for stakes in the most prestigious and best performing brokerage houses or whether the smaller houses might be targetted for swallowing up to give banks an easy entry onto the Bourse Individual banks were reticent over likely strategy with their future partners Discussions will get underway soon but no specific choice of broker has been made yet a spokesman for Credit Lyonnais who declined to be named said Balladur s project does not touch on dealing commissions but many dealers said the question had to be addressed since current bank commission was higher than that of brokers because banks who cannot deal directly in shares have to pay a fee to the broker they use for customer trading According to a study by the Bourse official watchdog body COB in January dealing fees on a transaction in shares for a gross total of 1 000 francs were 14 86 pct if the order was placed directly by a broker against 20 79 pct for the same order passed through a bank Xavier Dupont Chairman of the Stockbrokers Association said the reform would not mean an end to the fixed scale of commissions He said the overall reform would give the French financial markets a dynamic and efficient organisation But as both brokers and bankers commented let s wait and see REUTER

CBT HEAD SAYS POSITION LIMITS HAVE NO PURPOSE By Bruce Clark Reuters CHICAGO March 12 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC should increase speculative position limits on agricultural futures and do away with them for financial futures Chicago Board of Trade CBT chairman Karsten Mahlmann said Reporting to the CFTC Financial Products Advisory Committee on the conclusions so far of an ad hoc CBT committee on off exchange trading issues Mahlmann said We came to the conclusion that no meaningful purpose is served by speculative position limits Position limits were supposed to prevent market manipulation but I would submit that the Exchange and the CFTC currently have all the tools necessary to prevent market manipulation whether an account is speculative or a hedge the CBT chairman said Malmann said the issue was of particular concern to the CBT because the exchange faced increasing competition from foreign markets most of which did not have position limits He said the ad hoc committee which he also chairs had agreed to propose that the definition of hedging be expanded to include risk management as well as risk reduction Mahlmann said there was a danger that if a category of trading was given a name such as non speculative hedging insurance companies and pension funds might be held back from engaging in it by the regulatory bodies that govern such entities The ad hoc committee proposed the establishment of prudence guidelines and a list of market activities that fell within those lines which might be lengthened in the future he said The committee might also propose that CBT itself be allowed to enforce position limits on agricultural futures he added Reuter

JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM ECONOMISTS SAY By Rich Miller Reuters TOKYO March 12 The worst may be just about over for Japan s battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economy s 18 month old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year helped by rising exports stepped up government spending and falling prices The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed It the bottom is in the offing he said But he added that the recovery will be slow Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick up 2 2 pct from two pct in the current year he said Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year on year basis after declining toward the end of last year Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery Industrial production fell 0 7 pct in January much smaller than expected and is forecast by the government to rise 0 3 pct in February and 2 6 pct in March A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end they said Six nations the U K Canada France Japan the U S And West Germany pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels The yen s 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export driven economy hard by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U S Market The important thing is the exchange rate Taketomi said If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment although there are no signs of that yet economists said A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U S economy may be starting to recover economists said Domestically the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government s tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd The next reading of the economy s health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter 1986 Most private economists expect a rise of about 0 5 pct from the previous quarter In the third quarter GNP rose 0 6 pct But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter on quarter But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity To maintain year on year growth of around 2 5 pct the economy would have had to rise about 1 2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986 the official said Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government s sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986 Because the coins were classified as legal tender their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller than normal end year bonuses they said As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold the government s contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted economists said Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected while that of the external sector was better REUTER

NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED By Richard Jarvie Reuters RIO DE JANEIRO March 12 The Brazilian Coffee Institute IBC is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest trade sources said IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers producers exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil s position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization ICO export quotas The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely one Santos exporter said A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday March 19 and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5 5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets they said They noted that on February 16 the eve of a planned increase in the quota April registrations were opened and closed after 1 68 mln bags were registered for export a record amount for a single day If May June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2 0 mln bags per month The problem would be how to limit sales one exporter said Brazil s present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings However the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil s dominant position as an exporter but without causing a price war General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1 5 and 2 0 mln would be to non members of the ICO The 15 5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7 0 mln the sources added However the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers markets Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts thus re establishing Brazil s market share after last year s unusually low exports of 9 9 mln bags enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil s stance at the ICO talks they added Reuter

PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS By Pascal Fletcher Reuters LISBON March 12 A Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers grain traders and officials said Under the terms of Portugal s January 1986 accession to the European Community EC a grain import monopoly held by EPAC Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country s annual import needs The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon s civil court in a preliminary ruling had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders Trade sources said the ruling though effective immediately was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that as a result of the court s decision the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80 000 tonnes of corn Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC s participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency s import monopoly It also said the participation of EPAC which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network was unfair competition to the private traders Traders said they believed the EC s Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue They the EC Commission will be keeping a low profile one trader said ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary Reuter 
U S RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND ANALYSTS By Kathleen Hays Reuters NEW YORK March 12 U S retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak February retail sales jumped 4 1 pct more than the 2 5 3 0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated But January s sales were revised down to a 7 4 pct drop from a previously reported 5 8 pct decline The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing Combining the latest data with a 0 6 pct drop in November and a 4 6 pct gain in December the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0 2 pct he said compared to to a 0 4 pct rise for year over year sales through February You can see a pattern developing Maude said I wouldn t be surprised to see a fall off in March especially since sales probably won t be boosted by auto sales as they were in February Despite the weak underlying trend economists were impressed by a robust 1 5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February This compared to a revised 0 4 pct decline in January previously reported as a 0 1 pct decline The increase in non auto sales was broadbased with gains in durable goods as well as non durables noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc It was a pretty healthy report He noted that building materials rose 1 8 pct in February after falling 1 7 pct in January General merchandise store sales gained 1 4 pct after a 1 6 pct rise in January There are signs of life in the economy McCarthy said But it s jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future A 0 7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February he said A lot of people may be inadvertently under withholding taxes from their paychecks he said When people in this country get an increase in disposable income the inclination is to go out and spend it he said Economists said tomorrow s release of U S auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending Auto sales accounted for the lion s share of total February sales rising 14 4 pct This followed a 27 7 pct drop in January previously reported as a 22 4 pct fall due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1 the Commerce Department noted Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January the strength in the February report is less than impressive There is strength in the February data but that s because they were compared to low sales levels in January said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc We don t see it as a precursor of continued strength Durable goods sales rose 8 8 pct in February after falling 17 7 pct in January February non durable goods sales gained 1 3 pct after declining 0 2 pct in January Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February following a 1 9 pct gain in January but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 she said In January they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117 52 bilion dlrs and in February rose to 122 29 billion dlrs On average it looks like they ll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer she said We don t look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing he said Before the 337 000 gain in February non farm payroll employment I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March he said But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U S gross national product data in April to sort things out Reuter

PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP By Richard Jarvie Reuters RIO DE JANEIRO March 12 Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2 0 mln to 2 5 mln bag range against 2 5 mln to 3 0 mln a fortnight ago Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid February which broke a six week drought plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May September crop The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600 000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1 0 mln to 1 5 mln bags might be expected Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered However the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid and which is more likely from late July on This year s crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500 000 bags in a very short period one source said Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2 0 mln bag mark if the disease hits Although flowering was good following the start of the rains pod setting was not up to expectations possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers the sources said However reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good which should result in mature fruit from August through September The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop which officially starts on October 1 The cut off date is completely artificial If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December one said If predictions of a 2 0 to 2 5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2 7 mln bag average for the past 10 years The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1 79 mln bags the lowest since 1974 Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3 12 mln bags just below the 1983 3 17 mln bag record while last year s output which also suffered some drought damage was 2 77 mln bags Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year s record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30 Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared Because of the high turnover of beans this year significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals With official arrivals figures for the 1986 87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6 1 mln bags and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year the total outturn should be at least a record 6 5 mln bags if all production is declared the sources said This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6 03 mln However there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986 87 harvest may never be officially registered Reuter

TALKING POINT PUROLATOR COURIER CORP PCC By Patti Domm Reuter New York March 12 Purolator Courier corp s stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would find a new suitor for the company traders said Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr a share 265 mln dlr offer from E F Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of its Purolator courier division s management The stock today hit 36 1 4 up one Today Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10 The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal Gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity or if it could sell off all or part of its U S courier division Basically the courier division is a company that has 450 mln dlrs in revenues It s a very large company and it s being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs said Gardner in a telephone interview with Reuters Gardner is an official of Kelso Management a firm associated with Fidelity International Ltd A group of Fidelity companies owns eight pct of Purolator and Gardner said he personally owns 20 000 shares A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from Gardner Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator Before the transaction with Hutton LBO was announced analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again There s no shortage of possibilities It s just a question of management s willingness to let the process continue said one arbitrager Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs cash per share The balance of Purolator s stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U S courier operations The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant majority equity interest in Purolator As far as I can tell from the public documents from the deal that s on the table Hutton is basically putting up zero One always likes a situation like that You always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher said one arbitrager The firm however is supplying temporary financing and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the E F Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction the sources said there is some risk to the firm There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash and all sorts of things that make it very speculative said one of the sources adding there are also severance payments to employees The E F Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs in so called bridge financing for the transaction The bridge financing is a temporary loan from Hutton The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing expected to come from banks However it may take some time to replace the financing the source said resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln dlrs from the transaction but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale It s a very complex transaction but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place Gardner said Reuter

GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0 92 FARM PLAN WASHINGTON March 12 Implementation of a one year 0 92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions We have a budget driven farm policy It may be a shame but we are locked into this said Dan Glickman D Kans chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer A 0 92 plan if properly done could do both Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0 92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week Glickman said a 0 92 program which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill only an extension of the 50 92 option already provided under the current bill It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill he said but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals a voluntary 0 92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices as USDA has proposed A 0 92 plan however would not be decoupling but simply a different type of acreage diversion program Glickman said Decoupling delinking planting decisions from government payments is too much of a policy change to approve at this point he said I don t think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year Period Unequivocal Glickman said at the hearing Sen Rudy Boschwitz R Minn cosponsor of the Boren Boschwitz decoupling plan said he supports a short term 0 92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0 92 plan in the senate His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 but we can at least move in that direction Boschwitz said Robbin Johnson vice president of Cargill Inc testified in favor of decoupling Decoupling would end the current bias in U S farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers dependency on the government he said A 0 92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling Johnson said and would still encourage farmers to plant Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen s Association said their groups oppose any 0 92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0 92 program Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0 92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels Reuter 
MILLER SAYS NO U S TAX HIKES TO CUT DEFICIT DALLAS March 12 Director of the Office of Management and Budget James Miller said the Reagan administration had no intention of raising taxes in order to reduce the federal budget deficit There will be no tax increases he said three times before a Management Briefing luncheon of Southern Methodist University s Edwin L Cox School of Business The budget deficit which is currently slated at 173 billion dlrs for fiscal 1988 is supposed to be reduced to 108 billion dlrs under the provisions of the Gramm Rudman Act which calls for a balanced budget by fiscal 1991 Miller said he believes the budget deficit can be reduced but added the surest way to put us in a pickle would be to raise or ease the Gramm Rudman goal If we were to raise taxes so soon after tax reform it would create enormous uncertainty on the financial markets he said adding that giving up on the will to reduce the deficit would also create uncertainty Miller reiterated the president s budget proposal that the deficit could be reduced by a total of 42 billion dlrs through increased revenues and spending cuts An additional 23 billion dlrs from economic growth is expected to result in the budget deficit being reduced to the 108 billion dlr target Miller said it was possible the Administration might support an oil import fee but added that the President was concerned that such a move might have more adverse results than benefits He also said the Administration was seeking to spin off Amtrak which costs the government about 500 mln dlrs a year but added that he did not expect it to be accomplished this year Reuter

DOME DMP SAYS MOST LENDERS SUPPORT DEBT PLAN CALGARY Alberta March 12 Dome Petroleum Ltd said a majority of a group of 56 major creditors support the company s revised proposal to restructure debt of more than 6 1 billion Canadian dlrs Outlining terms of the plan circulated to the lenders earlier this week the company said it is seeking approval in principle for the proposal within the next several weeks in order to implement the debt rescheduling by June 30 1987 Although at today s price levels it only allows the company to struggle on benefits appear as oil prices rise Dome chairman J Howard Macdonald said in a statement We believe the plan is a rational one and will be valid under a range of circumstances chairman Macdonald said The lenders previously agreed to an interim debt rescheduling until June 30 to allow Dome time to negotiate a long term recapitalization The debt proposal is designed to ensure continued existence of the company which would see lenders get maximum recovery of their loans Dome said The plan would maintain debt levels within Dome s ability to pay subject to minimum debt service levels for each lender Dome said the debt proposal offers measures such as equity conversion options and reclassification to lower interest bearing categories of debt to accomplish its objectives Under certain circumstances lenders will have the option to convert all or part of their debt to common shares at a pre determined conversion rate upon plan implementation The various conversion rates remain to be set through negotiations and the company said it is impossible to predict the extent to which the conversion option will be exercised and the amount of dilution that may result Converting debt to common shares after the plan is implemented would be at a much higher conversion price Dome said Common shareholders will be asked to approve the plan before it is put in place Debt that remains after share conversion will either receive scheduled payments based on contract interest rates and a 15 to 20 year pay out or interest rates indexed to oil prices The company will use both an annual security to debt ratio test and a monthly cash flow test to classify which interest payments are paid on the different portions of debt To achieve a stable operating base for the company the plan provides for deducting operating costs capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses before the remaining available cash flow is distributed to lenders Dome said The proposal also assumes efforts will continue to operate the business as efficiently as possible it said As the company previously said debt payments from cash flow be divided into two broad categories secured and unsecured creditors Terms of the debt plan include paying institutional unsecured creditors comprising mostly banks who hold private debt from cash flow generated by unpledged assets This portion will get a fixed low interest rate under a 15 year repayment schedule Remaining institutional unsecured debt will get paid through convertible oil indexed unsecured debt that matures in 20 years or any available excess cash flow or conversion to equity Any institutional lender also has the option of taking all or part of its debt in common shares To offer public unsecured debtholders liquidity Dome said they can also convert all or part of their debt to common shares when the plan is implemented Any debt leftover would be exchanged for a convertible debenture with an interest rate linked to oil prices Secured creditors would get paid from cashflow generated by the assets pledged against their debt under a complex formula the company said Any shortfalls under the formula could also be converted to oil linked debentures Reuter 
VOLCKER SEES PROBLEMS REMAINING IN SOME SECTORS LOS ANGELES March 12 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said severe problems remain in some sectors of the U S economy despite progress in others Severe problems in some sectors of the economy are all too obvious he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon of business leaders here He said oil exploration and development as well as agricultural prices have been heavily affected by worldwide surpluses Commercial construction he said is suffering from earlier over building in many areas More broadly he said there are distortions and imbalances in the U S economy that cut across many sectors Unless dealt with effectively and forcibly they will undermine all that has been achieved Volcker warned He said one problem is that economic activity over the past two years has been supported largely by consumption He said that rising consumption was achieved at the expense of reduced personal savings At the same time he said the huge Federal budget deficit is absorbing a disproportionate amount of the savings generated in the U S Volcker said the adverse consequences of the combination of low savings rates and high Federal budget deficits have been escaped by drawing on capital from abroad He noted that the net flow of foreign capital into the U S in 1986 exceeded all the savings by U S households That is a graphic demonstration of the extent to which our financial markets are hostage to possible changes in external attitudes and circumstances Volcker said Reuter 
BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT By Paul Iredale Reuters LA PAZ March 12 Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct central bank president Jier Nogales said Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia s creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets he added Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March 1984 and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy backs but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold and would make a single non negotiable offer He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries let alone commercial banks The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions he added We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable Nogales said Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year but I don t know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time he added Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia s four billion dlr foreign debt 2 5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989 Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules he added He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year he added Nogales said that Bolivia s net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August 1985 Nogales said inflation which soared to over 20 000 pct a year in the government s first month in office was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months and the plan was that it should continue at this level He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates Reuter

SEC ASKS NYSE TO TIGHTEN TRIPLE WITCHING PROCESS WASHINGTON March 12 The Securities and Exchange Commission asked the New York Stock Exchange to tighten an experimental procedure used in the past six months to dampen volatility linked to the so called triple witching hour The Big Board has been collecting and publicizing information on large imbalances of market on close MOC orders placed on 50 major stocks one half hour before closing on so called expiration Fridays in September and December Expiration Fridays or triple witching hours occur every three months when stock options stock index options and futures on index options expire simultaneously As aribrageurs liquidated their futures and options on previous expiration Fridays they sold huge amounts of stock which they had used to offset their positions The huge sell orders which usually entered the market in the final frantic minutes on expiration Fridays triggered wild price swings in the 50 stocks which serve as the basis for the options and futures The gyrations prompted the SEC last September to request that the Big Board ask its members submit all MOCs by 1530 hrs on expiration Fridays which would then be made public giving the market a half hour to settle order imbalances But in a March 12 letter to NYSE President Robert Birnbaum SEC Director of Market Regulation cited problems in the experimental procedure during the Dec 19 expiration Friday A large number of MOC buy orders were not placed until after 1530 EST on Dec 19 which helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 21 points in the final minutes of the day to a 14 20 point gain on the day Ketchum said Citing the SEC s concern about such trading Ketchum asked the exchange to tighten its procedure by not accepting any pre existing MOC orders after 1530 if they could have been placed earlier The new restriction which SEC officials said merely clarifies the terms of the existing experimental procedure would bar the liquidation of stocks through MOC orders for arbitrage purposes after 1530 hrs even if they offset other reported order imbalances in those stocks The only MOC orders the SEC will allow to be placed after 1530 EST on March 20 the next expiration Friday are those that are received by Big Board member firms after 1530 EST and which help reduce existing order imbalances Ketchum said If there are no published imbalances in a particular stock no MOC orders will be accepted in that stock he said If dissemination of MOC orders is to provide an accurate indication of true order imbalances then all existing MOC orders must be submitted by 3 30 p m and only those new MOC orders responding to reported imbalances can be permitted Ketchum said The letter did not say how the SEC or the NYSE would determine the difference between pre existing MOC orders that would be barred and new MOC orders that would be allowed to reduce imbalances But an SEC official said the agency hopes the NYSE and its members would adhere to the rules in a spirit of cooperation REUTER

FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY By Martin Cherrin Reuters NEW YORK March 12 U S bank reserve monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is on hold and may not be changed for weeks or even months economists said The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc Fed data released today were all in line with economists expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that It said that banks net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously Finally the Fed said that the M 1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February with the broader M 2 measure down 1 6 billion dlrs and M 3 up an even three billion dlrs Analysts said that M 1 last month grew at a negative 1 3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0 7 pct for M 2 and actual positive growth of 1 0 pct annualized for M 3 February levels of M 2 and M 3 left the aggregates 18 2 and 20 8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987 The annual growth target for both is 5 1 2 to 8 1 2 pct There is no M 1 target In the near term there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy even apart from the slowdown in money growth said Stephen Slifer economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February s anemic growth rates However they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness Commenting on February s decline in the key M 2 aggregate Slifer said the main cause was a 3 2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while he said so February s weakness is not likely to persist Slifer expects modest M 2 and M 3 growth rates of 3 1 2 to four pct during March Griggs said that M 2 and M 3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves Given the economy s fragility in many sectors the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise rather than lower interest rates when it next changes policy Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them although Fed funds held above six pct said Williams of Bankers Trust Funds averaged 6 12 pct in the week to Wednesday up from 6 06 pct in the prior week The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday 2 5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday On Tuesday it added reserves directly through two day System repurchases Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market driven They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs Reuter

TAX REVENUES BOOST U K BUDGET OPTIONS By Sten Stovall Reuters LONDON March 13 A mix of electoral boldness and fiscal caution is expected from Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson next week when he unveils his budget for fiscal 1987 88 Exceptionally robust tax revenues have given Lawson very favourable budget options with which to please voters industry and financial markets alike The budget will Lawson s fourth and probably the last from the Conservative government before the next general election political analysts say Analysts said the major budget question is how Lawson will balance expected tax cuts with lower public borrowing and allow for fresh falls in U K Interest rates They said a boost given to the economy by consumer spending has helped reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement PSBR for financial 1986 87 from an originally targetted 7 1 billion stg despite big rises in government spending Economists say Lawson may have up to five billion stg to split between income tax cuts and other electoral sweeteners higher spending and a drop in borrowing while still meeting his earlier 1987 88 PSBR target of 7 0 billion stg The decision facing Lawson is how best to use that so called fiscal adjustement to maximise the government s all round popularity ahead of the next general election Economist Ian Harwood of Warburg Securities said Lawson s budget must strike a balance between tax cuts aimed at home consumption and lower public borrowing for attracting support from overseas investors Peter Fellner of James Capel and Co said a budget which concentrates on tax cuts for the consumer will be a budget for an early election Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must call a poll before June 1988 But anticipation of a summer or autumn 1987 ballot has risen as the opposition Labour Party has slipped in voter surveys Forecasts that the economy may deteriorate later this year add to arguments for an early poll analysts say The Conservatives have pledged to cut the basic rate of taxation in the U K From the current 29 pct level to 25 pct While confirming that aim Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last month seemed to dash speculation that that would happen in the near future She said in a television interview that it would happen Eventually But I think it will be eventually Most market analysts now expect a two pence reduction in the basic rate of taxation and a lowering in of the top rate of income tax from 60 pct A one billion stg cut in the 1987 88 PSBR to six billion stg is considered the minimum needed for reassuring financial markets they add The Treasury s inflow of tax receipts has far surpassed that previously envisaged economists say Lawson as recently as December 17 said that I very much doubt whether there will be much scope for reductions in taxation in next year s budget The Conservative government is eager to get the basic rate of tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible since every pound off the tax base would make the opposition Labour Party s spending plans look more painful to the electorate analysts say The direct revenue effect of a one penny change in the basic rate of income tax would be about 1 1 billion stg in 1987 88 and 1 45 billion stg in 1988 89 Treasury figures show Lawson s budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday starts at 1530 GMT and is sure to echo the government s distinct tone of optimism analysts say The tax measures which Lawson is expected to announce will be based firmly on a positive assessment of past economic achievements and confidence for the future they add But even if he does cut his planned PSBR for 1987 88 by between one and 1 5 billion stg as most economists predict Lawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher PSBR than the outturn for this financial year M That could leave him with a presentation problem economists say A lower PSBR would raise financial confidence by reassuring markets that the borrowing burden imposed by the government would stay low even if certain key aspects of the budget s arithmetic seem over optimistic economists say Lawson is slated to reaffirm the government s goals as set out in its Medium Term Financial Strategy MTFS of reducing inflation and raising economic growth Regarding monetary targets some analysts expect him to drop the wayward broad money aggregate sterling M 3 while retaining the tamer M0 narrow measure Few foresee any other monetary aggregate being chosen by Lawson for formal targeting Analysts were surprised this week when the government sanctioned a half percentage point cut in interest rates in an attempt to cool down sterling and the gilts market Analysts had expected the authorities to wait until after the budget Further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipated after the budget Many analysts foresee them falling by as much as a full percentage point from the current 10 5 pct level The main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates is to cut mortgage borrowing costs and thus reduce inflation analysts say Each one percentage point cut in the mortgage rate reduces retail prices by 0 4 pct government figures show REUTER

U S OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING DEFICIT NEW YORK March 13 Senior U S Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers reiterated the Reagan Administration s opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth By contrast Rudolph Penner Director of the Congressional Budget Office said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987 Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments He also suggested a line item veto which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it to limit wasteful spending Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2 7 pct growth in U S Real gross national product GNP in 1987 and 3 5 pct in 1988 Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable Sprinkel said It looks pretty good to me We ve had two very strong employment reports He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate adding It looks like they re on track While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives he said Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long run consequences of tax reform Sprinkel said In 1986 this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit In fiscal 1986 ending September federal spending amounted to 23 8 pct of GNP while federal receipts absorbed 18 5 pct of GNP leaving a deficit of 5 3 pct he said Sprinkel said that compared with fiscal 1978 the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2 7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same Contrary to the conventional wisdom therefore the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years Sprinkel said This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981 he added However the Congressional Budget Office s Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress indeed with increases in defence spending now all the options for reducing the budget deficit are unpleasant he said Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U S Caused by the biggest sustained inflation in our nation s history which helped foster widespread distrust of government The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level Penner said But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot Penner sees little hope the Gramm Rudman Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there s no Way to enforce it Penner said Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one time measures such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988 That saved more than two billion dlrs Penner said REUTER

U S FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT By Greg McCune Reuters WASHINGTON MARCH 13 Proposals for a secondary market for the resale of farm real estate loans similar to home mortgage markets is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be established this year Congressional and financial sources said Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate Furthermore Representatives of the Farm Credit System commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market Frank Naylor chairman of the Farm Credit Administration FCA which regulates the farm credit system yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture as long as the farm credit system is a key player Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages the Government National Mortgage Association GNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac industry sources said Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market because they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi government farm credit system traditionally the largest lender to farmers A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high quality loans on farmland to poolers who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage backed securities for resale to investors called Aggie mae by some supporters However the FCA and financially troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea The ambivalence is because any farm secondary market established in the private sector that excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage That could be a financial blow to the system which has lost 4 6 billion dlrs in two years Naylor and farm credit system officials have said A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea the American Council of Life Insurers concludes the farm credit system s market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established The study was released earlier today Reuter 
SALOMON INC SB SAID TO CUT U S BANKS RATINGS NEW YORK MARCH 13 Salomon Inc has lowered its investment ratings on all U S money center banks institutional sources said The sources said Salomon believes that other money center banks may feel compelled to follow Citicorp s CCI lead in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to its loan exposure to Brazil They also said Salomon believes that other banks may strongly consider the possibility of placing Brazilian loans on a non accruing status with the consequent negative impact on earnings The sources said the ratings were lowered to M from O plus The stock are now expected to match the Standard and Poor s 500 Index rather than outperform the index as previously expected The sources said it is also understood that the change in the coding of these stocks should definitely not be taken as a sell recommendation because Salomon is said to believe that its downgrading will only prove temporary The banks affected by the change in investment coding are Bank of New York Co Inc BT Chase Manhattan Corp CHL Citicorp MHC J P Morgan and Co Inc MM Republic New York Corp BKB and First Chicago Corp FNB The institutional sources said that Thomas Hanley a director of Salomon Inc subsidiary Salomon Brothers who is in charge of bank stock research believes Citicorp s move is well timed Should Citicorp actually place the Brazilian loans in a non performing category at the end of this quarter this action would serve to alleviate the urgency associated with the debt negotiations he argues Thus Citicorp s bargaining position would appear to have been much enhanced Reuter 
FRN PANIC INITIATED EXACERBATED BY MARKET MAKERS By Norma Cohen and Dominique Jackson Reuters LONDON March 13 Today s panic in the floating rate note market has been simmering for months and is in many ways of the market makers own doing traders and bank officials said For the last six months there have been a series of crises in the FRN market Each has cut deeper and deeper into the very fibre of the market said a senior official at a U S Bank As prices have fallen he explained the underwriters who originally brought the issues have retreated They have divested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible unwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panic trading In the virtual effective closure of the market for perpetual floaters last month bankers witnessed the consequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity and investor confidence Fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisis infecting the market in conventional dated FRN issues which is almost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals with an estimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding The professionals are so nervous about holding inventory that they will sell at any price said an official at a leading U S Bank explaining the panic selling which has pushed prices down sharply over the last two days Bankers and FRN traders emphasised that today s trading was unique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals and that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securities they sold In highlighting this point dealers noted that the benchmark issues in the FRN market the two FRN s for the U K Launched in 1985 and 1986 fell an unprecedented 50 and 40 basis points respectively at the opening this morning Certainly dealers said Britain is no less credit worthy today than it was yesterday and the country s economic health currently appears better than it has for some time Pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supra national debt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness one senior FRN source said The idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by the fact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicated loan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay Dealers agreed that banking sector paper which constitutes a significant part of the market was currently under pressure Floating rate debt of major U S And Canadian banks eased markedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investor fears about the banks exposure to Latin American debt The U S And Canadian money centre bank FRNs along with Republic of Ireland paper were hard hit again this week with dealers citing one heavily traded Citicorp note falling to levels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis points over Libor the London Interbank Offered Rate By comparison the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998 yielded only a fine 20 basis point over Libid the London Interbank Bid Rate when it was issued in January last year Price declines of this size can really only be explained by an understanding of the operating practices of leading players in the market dealers and banking analysts said This has to be understood as a matter between banks who have a brief to buy low and sell high one U S Bank source noted Another senior source at a U K Bank drew attention to the enormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over the last few years in the FRN market which have to be justified But even beyond the cost of running an FRN trading desk dealers said is the way the securities are bought and sold Although sophisticated on screen dealing exists in most markets in the euro markets trading is conducted by telephone If somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a price in any issue and you do he can say Right You own five mln a trader said explaining market practice The unfortunate buyer is then forced to unload the securities just minutes later to yet another firm at an even lower price the trader explained It is precisely this phenomenon that forced the rapid downward price spiral earlier today traders said adding that it is likely to continue until the markets either regain their confidence or market practices change One possible solution dealers said would be to initiate trading exclusively through brokers screens so that only those who wanted to buy bonds would have to lift a bid or buy at that price Meanwhile bank regulators are apparently concerned about the implications of the collapse in FRN prices Traders in London said that the Bank of England has called around to market makers asking whether they intended to continue trading and what they calculated the losses to be The Bank often makes periodic checks in the market but dealers said the latest enquiries were more specific A spokesman for the Bank of England was not able to comment immediately on the Bank s action One trader at a major U S Bank here said that in addition the Federal Reserve Bank of New York s international capital markets unit has phoned banks in London today seeking information about trading in FRN s He also said that this was not an unusual procedure Reuter

PROPOSALS TO RELAX U S DRUG LAWS POSE PROBLEMS By Marjorie Shaffer Reuters NEW YORK March 13 The Reagan Administration s soon to be published proposals to make experimental therapies more rapidly and widely available to terminally ill patients pose product liability problems for drug companies experts in the pharmaceutical field said Details of the proposals will be published in the Federal Register shortly and will become effective after a 90 day comment period Under the proposed policy announced Tuesday by Commissioner of Food and Drugs Frank E Young at a press conference patients with life threatening diseases who are not enrolled in clinical trials would be allowed access to an experimental therapy The policy also allows drug companies to sell the promising drugs to patients Previously drugs like AZT could be rushed into wider use free of charge if the agent was shown to be effective Under the new policy the FDA could only refuse to permit a physician to administer an experimental drug if it was shown to be unsafe Financial analysts said the plan would likely benefit biotechnology companies with few or no products approved for marketing in the U S but would have little economic impact on large drug companies with many other sources of revenue Charging a fee for still experimental drugs could help biotech companies near term financial situation and help make them less dependent on outside sources said Teena Lerner a biotech analyst at L F Rothchild Other observers were concerned that drug companies would be put into a legal bind if promising drugs later proved to have devastating side effects Before a lot of drug companies release these drugs they are going to have to think long and hard about liability the product liability problems are enormous said a Washington based lawyer who specializes in the drug field Patients in clinical trials normally sign lengthy informed consent papers before taking an investigational drug The lawyer said no more than two cases had gone to trial for suits against a drug company s investigational drug The new proposals are a whole new kettle of fish said the lawyer Drug companies are right now probably meeting with their insurance companies Burroughs Wellcome Co the U S arm of the British firm Wellcome PLC that makes AZT Merck and Co Inc MRK Hoffman LaRoche Inc and SmithKline Beckman Corp SKB said it was too soon to comment on the policy I m very uncomforable with this said Wellcome spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett We haven t had a chance to formulate a response yet It s too early But some financial analysts say the proposals would benefit drug companies I find the proposal to be a very significant alteration of the FDA s past policies that should positively affect drug companies stocks said drug analyst Davis Saks with Morgan Olmstead Kennedy and Gardner Saks also warned that many health care providers would balk at the proposal and would call it amoral to charge patients with life threatening diseases for drugs that otherwise would be given out for free in clinical trials Jeffrey Warren spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association which represents the major drug firms in the U S said A mechanism already exists at the FDA permitting certain seriously ill patients access to experimental drugs and perhaps that system can be approved Warren acknowledged that the PMA may not be able to come up with a consensus among its membership when the rules are formally published He also admitted that product liability problems could be a concern to major drug companies Jeffrey Levi executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force which is actively in AIDS policy and funding issues cited the drug Suramin from Bayer AG BAYRY which had shown early promise as an AIDS treatment but on wider clinical testing was shown to have deadly side effects Reuter

TALKING POINT DOME PETROLEUM DMP By Larry Welsh Reuters TORONTO March 13 Dome Petroleum Ltd s revised debt restructuring plan keeps the company alive and improves its appeal as a takeover target but full debt repayment depends on a sharp oil price rise oil and banking analysts said Dome s complex proposal to let creditors link some or all of their debt to oil indexed debentures or convert it to equity is very cut and dried and to the point Peters and Co Ltd Calgary based energy analyst Wilf Gobert said Dome is saying This is the way it is There isn t enough money to pay you back he added The plan strikes me as a very pragmatic thing to do First Marathon Securities Ltd oil analyst Jim Doak commented He said the plan seeks to formally tie payments to creditors with the price of oil which governs Dome s cash flow and ability to service its debt Dome expects its total debt to reach 6 4 billion Canadian dlrs by June 30 1987 when an interim debt rescheduling plan expires and Dome hopes to implement the long term plan Gobert said the plan would rank secured and unsecured creditors in a complex series of repayment categories or an agreed pecking order of what your creditors claim to assets is Potential suitors would find Dome easier to swallow under the debt restructuring plan because it proposes to resolve competing claims on assets pledged to secured creditors and on remaining unpledged assets Gobert and others said Certainly the restructuring plan once it s agreed to and put in place is going to make it easier for someone to come in and look at doing a deal on it acquiring the company Gobert remarked It s going to be a lot easier than it is right now because you ll have settled the pecking order question he added Gobert believes the debt plan may be partly motivated by a desire to sell Dome Petroleum as a whole If the creditors wanted to liquidate their bank loans they could do it in an orderly fashion through the sale of the company as opposed to dismemberment he said Dome s proposal includes rescheduling secured debt payments over a 15 to 20 year schedule linking payments to cash flows generated by assets pledged against loans and establishing interest rates that allow for changing oil prices Creditors only real alternative to Dome s plan is an asset grab which would liquidate the company at distress prices and the banks would spend the next 20 years in court deciding who had what asset First Marathon s Doak said For Dome s creditors the plan does not offer a quick method to recover loans but extends payment time in the hope that oil prices will rise increasing the amount of the company s debt payments Merrill Lynch Canada Inc bank analyst Terry Shaunessy said The plan is not a solution It says give me more time and let s keep our fingers crossed that oil goes way up Doak and Shaunessy estimated oil prices would have to rise to about 28 to 30 U S dlrs a barrel to fully service all of the company s debt Analysts said the plan would ensure the company continues to operate but provides little other benefit to common shareholders From a common shareholder standpoint all this does is sort of keep him on the life support system because there isn t any equity unless you get a big increase in oil prices Gobert remarked Analysts said Dome s common shares trading today at 1 12 dlrs off four cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange essentially represent a long term warrant pegged to oil prices You have to be looking at an extremely high price of oil in the context of historical trends before there s any residual value for the common shareholders analyst Doak said While Dome s plan said lenders will be able to convert debt to common shares the amount of dilution depends on share conversion prices still to be negotiated and how much lenders would choose to convert the company said Reuter

MIDLAND UNIT PULLS OUT OF EQUITY MARKET MAKING LONDON March 13 Midland Bank Plc MDBL L said its Greenwell Montagu Securities unit would pull out of equity market making and concentrate instead on providing a broker dealer and agency service for its clients The operation has become the first major casualty in the London markets since deregulation last October abolished fixed commissions and allowed the merging of broking and jobbing operations into market making activities A spokesman said Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged which is a primary gilt edged market maker and Greenwell Montagu stockbrokers were not affected by the decision The market making operation had encountered much greater competition than had been expected in the post Big Bang period the spokesman added Although Midland considered that the operation would be viable in the long term it would require the concentration of greater resources than could be justified for an operation that was not a core Midland activity He confirmed Greenwell Montagu Securities had been losing money in past months The pull out from market making would be conducted in an orderly fashion in the near future There might also be some job losses he said without giving any details Market sources said it was no great surprise that a market maker had pulled out as the intensity of competition had suggested for some time that sooner or later someone would decide to withdraw They said some retreat by Greenwell had been likely because of its losses and added there also been speculation that it could pull out of market making in gilts also The move was unlikely to have any major impact on market confidence as the occasional speculation in the past few weeks had had little impact Analysts said commission rates on institutional equity trades have dropped sharply in the five months since deregulation with some firms covering some of their reduced profits by trading on their own account In a recent report Greenwell Montagu Research said Those who have made profits are either immensely clever or immensely lucky Some are already approaching the pain barrier others are prepared to tough it out But until some players withdraw from the market it will be difficult to improve profitability Dealers said the pace of withdrawals was likely to speed up in the next year and would intensify if the three month bull run on the London stock exchange petered out REUTER

FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U S FEBRUARY ECONOMY By Kathleen Hays Reuters NEW YORK March 13 U S February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said If you re the Fed there s no reason to do anything said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc There are hints that GNP is picking up On the inflation front all is well he said Money supply is well under control It s an absolutely ideal situation February U S industrial production rose 0 5 pct slightly less than the 0 7 pct gain the financial markets had expected This compared with a slim 0 1 pct rise in January s production number previously reported as a 0 4 pct increase The February U S producer price index gained only 0 1 pct less than a 0 3 0 4 pct expected rise This followed a 0 6 pct rise in the PPI in January The Fed is going to look at this positively said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants The energy products component of PPI rose 4 0 pct in February after a 9 8 pct increase in January This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc The trend is still 3 5 pct in the first half of the year In 1986 declining energy prices contributed to a 2 5 pct decline in the PPI Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected but a sharp drop in auto prices was not Passenger car prices fell 3 4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1 3 pct Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said We need inflation for U S producers to compete with foreign producers Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0 8 pct in February s PPI With many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U S competitiveness he said If further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in U S debt Brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11 8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987 Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8 5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 which has contributed to rising U S industrial output It s the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0 3 0 4 pct in the first quarter It s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production Utilities output rose 0 7 pct in February after gaining 1 2 pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8 3 million units at an annual rate from 7 5 million units In the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an 8 5 mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U S business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 January business inventories rose 0 9 pct the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1 7 pct the Commerce Department said Business sales dropped 4 5 pct in January the largest monthly sales drop on record Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react to month to month changes The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months Ramirez said They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months Reuter

U S FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT By Greg McCune Reuters WASHINGTON March 13 A secondary market for resale of farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be set up this year Congressional and financial sources said Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate Furthermore Representatives of the Farm Credit System commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market Frank Naylor chairman of the Farm Credit Administration FCA which regulates the farm credit system yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture as long as the farm credit system is a key player Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages the Government National Mortgage Association GNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac industry sources said Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi government farm credit system traditionally the largest lender to farmers A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high quality loans on farmland to poolers who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage backed securities for resale to investors called Aggie mae by some proponents The FCA and financially troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea mainly because any farm secondary market established in the private sector which excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to the system which has lost 4 6 billion dlrs in two years Naylor and farm credit system officials have said However the system and FCA have become more positive to the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were appointed the agent for a secondary market If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools of farm mortgage loans it would benefit from the fees charged for providing this service the Life Insurers study said Congressional sources believe a secondary market available to both private lenders and the farm credit system with the system as agent could be included in a major federal government rescue package for the system to be drafted by Congress later this year A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea the American Council of Life Insurers concludes that the farm credit system s market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established The study was released earlier today The study said a secondary market could be established with virtually no federal money if the government provided a guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private co insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why leading U S farm organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea Proponents say a secondary market also would increase liquidity in farm lending and spread the risk of such loans Reuter
